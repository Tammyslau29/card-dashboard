# Card Dashboard

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Design Questions

### How else might you have improved your solution given more time?

1. Given more time, I would have liked to implement React-Redux. It would be beneficial to store the card data, and transaction data within the store. Each page would then use a selector to access the store and the appropriate data.

 Additionally, given more time, I would like to implement responsive design and tests.

### Feedback and Calibration

 1. I spent approximately 3 hours total on this project, including styling.

 2. The most interesting / rewarding part about this challenge was determining what was the best architecture in which to call and pass around data. I decided it was best to organize each major section of the page as a container that then contained passed it's data to presentational components.  

 3. The least interesting / rewarding part was adding the data table, using Material UI.
